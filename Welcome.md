The purpose of this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault is to be a public record of my understanding of programming language features and principles, breaking down each topic into plain language with examples with a focus on application in testing frameworks (or anything I happen to be interested in at the time).

I will link to any documentation I refer to and attempt to quote and attribute correctly. Anything written here is free to use verbatim, with proper attribution. 

Message me if you have a question. Log an [Issue](https://github.com/theRamenWithin/Obsidian-Public-Programming/issues) or open a [PR](https://github.com/theRamenWithin/Obsidian-Public-Programming/pulls) if you see a mistake, see something not attributed correctly or wish to offer a correction or elaborate.
